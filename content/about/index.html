<p>I am an analytical biochemist who works with mass spectrometry. My background is more on lipidomics, but I’m interested in all sorts of metabolomics research. I also just enjoy reading and writing about science (hence the site). More recently I’ve become an R enthusiast and enjoy learning and applying statistical methods/functions to large data sets.</p>
